# 100 Chairs Problem

This code solves the "100 chairs" programming challenge.

## The Challenge

One hundred people sit around a circular table (which must be the largest table on Earth). Each chair is numbered, from 1 to 100 (obviously). The person in chair 1 stands up and walks away. I have no idea why. Then, the person in chair 3 leaves, followed by the person in chair 6, and so on. This continues until only one person remains seated. Visually illustrate this. Because obviously that is the most important question, not 1) how you could even make such an enormous table, 2) why you would ever want one, and 3) how you could pass the salt.
